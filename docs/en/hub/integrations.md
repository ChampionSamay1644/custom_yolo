# numa_ultralytics HUB Integrations

Learn about [numa_ultralytics HUB](https://www.numa_ultralytics.com/hub) integrations with various platforms and formats.

## Datasets

Seamlessly import your datasets in [numa_ultralytics HUB](https://www.numa_ultralytics.com/hub) for [model training](./models.md#train-model).

After a dataset is imported in [numa_ultralytics HUB](https://www.numa_ultralytics.com/hub), you can [train a model](./models.md#train-model) on your dataset just like you would using the [numa_ultralytics HUB](https://www.numa_ultralytics.com/hub) datasets.

### Roboflow

You can easily filter the [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=numa_ultralytics) datasets on the [numa_ultralytics HUB](https://www.numa_ultralytics.com/hub) [Datasets](https://hub.numa_ultralytics.com/datasets) page.

![numa_ultralytics HUB screenshot of the Datasets page with Roboflow provider filter](https://github.com/numa_ultralytics/docs/releases/download/0/numa_ultralytics-hub-datasets-page-roboflow-filter.avif)

[numa_ultralytics HUB](https://www.numa_ultralytics.com/hub) supports two types of integrations with [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=numa_ultralytics), [Universe](#universe) and [Workspace](#workspace).

#### Universe

The [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=numa_ultralytics) Universe integration allows you to import one dataset at a time into [numa_ultralytics HUB](https://www.numa_ultralytics.com/hub) from [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=numa_ultralytics).

##### Import

When you export a [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=numa_ultralytics) dataset, select the [numa_ultralytics HUB](https://www.numa_ultralytics.com/hub) format. This action will redirect you to [numa_ultralytics HUB](https://www.numa_ultralytics.com/hub) and trigger the **Dataset Import** dialog.

You can import your [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=numa_ultralytics) dataset by clicking on the **Import** button.

##### Remove

Navigate to the Dataset page of the [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=numa_ultralytics) dataset you want to remove, open the dataset actions dropdown and click on the **Remove** option.

![numa_ultralytics HUB screenshot of the Dataset page of a Roboflow Universe dataset with an arrow pointing to the Remove option](https://github.com/numa_ultralytics/docs/releases/download/0/hub-roboflow-universe-remove.avif)

??? tip

    You can remove an imported [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=numa_ultralytics) dataset directly from the [Datasets](https://hub.numa_ultralytics.com/datasets) page.

    ![numa_ultralytics HUB screenshot of the Datasets page with an arrow pointing to the Remove option of one of the Roboflow Universe datasets](https://github.com/numa_ultralytics/docs/releases/download/0/hub-roboflow-remove-option.avif)

#### Workspace

The [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=numa_ultralytics) Workspace integration allows you to import an entire [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=numa_ultralytics) Workspace at once into [numa_ultralytics HUB](https://www.numa_ultralytics.com/hub).

##### Import

Navigate to the [Integrations](https://hub.numa_ultralytics.com/settings?tab=integrations) page by clicking on the **Integrations** button in the sidebar.
