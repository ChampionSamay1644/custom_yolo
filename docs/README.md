## üöÄ Building and Serving Locally

The `mkdocs serve` command builds and serves a local version of your MkDocs documentation, ideal for development and testing:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

- #### Command Breakdown:

  - `mkdocs` is the main MkDocs command-line interface.
  - `serve` is the subcommand to build and locally serve your documentation.

- üßê Note:

  - Grasp changes to the docs in real-time as `mkdocs serve` supports live reloading.
  - To stop the local server, press `CTRL+C`.

## üåç Building and Serving Multi-Language

Supporting multi-language documentation? Follow these steps:

1. Stage all new language \*.md files with Git:

   ```bash
   git add docs/**/*.md -f
   ```

2. Build all languages to the `/site` folder, ensuring relevant root-level files are present:

   ```bash
   # Clear existing /site directory
   rm -rf site

   # Loop through each language config file and build
   mkdocs build -f docs/mkdocs.yml
   for file in docs/mkdocs_*.yml; do
     echo "Building MkDocs site with $file"
     mkdocs build -f "$file"
   done
   ```

3. To preview your site, initiate a simple HTTP server:

   ```bash
   cd site
   python -m http.server
   # Open in your preferred browser
   ```

- üñ•Ô∏è Access the live site at `http://localhost:8000`.

* ### GitHub Pages Deployment Example:

  ```bash
  mkdocs gh-deploy
  ```
